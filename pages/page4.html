        <p>• A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. The transistor is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics.</p>
        <p>• The first working device to be built was a point-contact transistor invented in 1947 by American physicists John Bardeen and Walter Brattain while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs. The three shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics for their achievement.</p>
        <p>• The MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), is by far the most widely used transistor, used in applications ranging from computers and electronics to communications technology such as smartphones.</p>
        <p>• The MOSFET has been considered to be the most important transistor, possibly the most important invention in electronics, and the birth of modern electronics. The US Patent and Trademark Office calls it a "groundbreaking invention that transformed life and culture around the world."</p>
        <p>• Transistors are the key active components in practically all modern electronics. Many thus consider the transistor to be one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century.</p>
