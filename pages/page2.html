    <p>• A wheel is a circular component that is intended to rotate on an axle bearing</p>
    <p>• A wheel reduces friction by facilitating motion by rolling together with the use of axles.</p>
    <p>• A wheeled vehicle requires much less work to move than simply dragging the same weight.</p>
    <p>• The wheel has also become a strong cultural and spiritual metaphor for a cycle or regular repetition.</p>
    <p>• In modern usage, the 'invention of the wheel' can be considered as a symbol of one of the first technologies of early civilization, and thus be used as a benchmark to grade the level of societal progress.</p>
