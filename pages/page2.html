    <p>• A printing press is a mechanical device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink.</p>
    <p>• In Germany, around 1440, goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press, which started the Printing Revolution.</p>
    <p>• The arrival of mechanical movable type printing in Europe in the Renaissance introduced the era of mass communication, which permanently altered the structure of society.</p>
    <p>• The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class.</p>
    <p>• The Printing Revolution occurred when the spread of the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of information and ideas, acting as an "agent of change" through the societies that it reached.</p>
